The non-Clojure versions of these benchmark programs have been
downloaded from this web site:

http://shootout.alioth.debian.org

I only have Clojure implementations for the k-nucleotide and
mandelbrot benchmarks so far (k-nucleotide is in the knuc
subdirectory).

I have hacked up some shell scripts to automate the compilation and
running of some of these programs.  They have been tested on Mac OS X
10.5.7 with appropriate installations of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler
ghc, SBCL Common Lisp, Perl, the version of Java distributed by Apple,
and a recent version of Clojure (either 1.0.0 or more recent, I don't
recall).  Getting SBCL and ghc installed is relatively straightforward
by installing MacPorts first.

You should edit the file env.sh to point at the location of your
Clojure JAR file, and perhaps give explicit path names to some of the
other language implementations, if you wish.

If you have those installed, you can run all of the implementations of
the k-nucleotide benchmark, with the quick, medium, and long test
input sizes, run these commands:

cd knuc
./batch.sh

You can also pick and choose which benchmark lengths to run, and which
language implementations to run, by giving options like these on the
command line:

./batch.sh java clj quick medium

That would run both the Clojure and Java versions of the benchmark,
each with the quick and medium size input files.  The following
command would run only the Clojure version with the long input file:

./batch.sh clj long

If you find any improvements to the Clojure versions, I'd love to hear
about them.

The file RESULTS contains some summarized execution times from running
these programs on my home iMac.  It also has copies of some of the
running times reported on the shootout web site above, which were run
on different machine (see RESULTS for some specs).
