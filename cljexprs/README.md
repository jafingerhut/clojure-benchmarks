# cljexprs

Use criterium to benchmark the run time of some Clojure expressions,
and present the results as graphs.


## Usage

First, update the following bash scripts in the directory above this
one.

File env.sh:

* Add all desired Clojure versions to be tested, and perhaps some that
  you do not want to test, if you want the list of released versions
  to be complete, to the variable ALL_CLOJURE_VERSIONS.

* Add any versions that are in ALL_CLOJURE_VERSIONS, but that you do
  not want to benchmark, to the list of versions to leave out in the
  expression that is assigned to ALL_BENCHMARK_CLOJURE_VERSIONS.

* Add new major versions to ALL_MAJOR_CLOJURE_VERSIONS.

* Update the cases in function internal_check_clojure_version_spec().

File lein-init.sh:

* Copy and edit new for loops to retrieve the desired versions of
  Clojure.


How long does it take to run a full set of Clojure expression
benchmarks?

As a rough estimate, running the current 49 expression benchmarks for
a single OS/JDK/Clojure version combination takes about 42 minutes.

If you have V versions of Clojure, each running 3 trials, on a single
OS/JDK, that will take about 126*V minutes.

Multiply that by the number of OS/JDK combinations you want to
benchmark, if they will be run sequentially on the same machine.

Plan for next update to the benchmarks is V=54 (from 1.3.0 betas up
through 1.8.0-RC2).  OS/JDK combos are planned to be:

* Mac OS X 10.6.8 + JDK 1.6.0_65
* Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS plus:
 * 32-bit and 64-bit versions of:
  * Oracle JDK 1.6.0_<something>
  * Oracle JDK 1.7.0_<something>
  * Oracle JDK 1.8.0_<something>
  * Oracle JDK 1.9.0_<something>

That is 9 versions.

(V Clojure versions) * (3 trials) * (42 mins) = 6,804 mins = 4.7 days

For 9 versions, that is 42.5 days.
